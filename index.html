        <p>Hello, I'm Shubham Yedekar, a dedicated Data Scientist passionate about solving real-world challenges through data-driven solutions. My journey started as a Software Engineer at Hexaware Technologies, where I honed my expertise in ETL validation, machine learning, and advanced analytics. Through roles like developing Python-driven predictive models and automating workflows, I achieved significant efficiency gains, such as reducing testing cycles by 50% and enhancing data quality for datasets exceeding 10GB.</p>
        <p>Currently pursuing an MS in Data Science at the University of Connecticut, with a GPA of 3.8, I specialize in statistical modeling, NLP, and generative AI. My academic journey is complemented by impactful projects, such as analyzing 3M+ transportation records to optimize urban systems and developing deep learning Autoencoders for anomaly detection in time-series data. These experiences have equipped me with robust technical skills in Python, SQL, PySpark, and frameworks like TensorFlow and Scikit-learn.</p>
        <p>I am driven by the vision of using data to create meaningful change, from enhancing business decision-making to improving customer satisfaction. Whether collaborating on machine learning innovations or delving into data engineering, I am always excited to tackle complex problems and deliver impactful solutions. Let’s connect and explore ways we can make a difference together.</p>
